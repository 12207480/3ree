## 3ree

An example universal JS application written with *Re*act + *Re*dux + *Re*thinkDB + *E*xpress. A stack for building apps, front and back end, with just Javascript.

This project was initially conceived to experiment with using these technologies in conjunction with one-another. I have written a [blog](http://blog.workshape.io/the-3ree-stack-react-redux-rethinkdb-express-js/) that relates to this repo.

It is still work in progress.

Main Features:
 - Universal (Isomorphic) Javascript
 - Asyncronous example
 - Use of RethinkDB Changefeeds for Realtime

Tech used:
 - React - view layer
 - Redux - state management
 - RethinkDB - persistance layer
 - Express - server framework
 - Socket.io - for realtime communication between clients and server
 - Webpack - module bundling + build for client
 - Jade - view templates
 - Superagent - universal http requests

To Do:
 - Add in React Router
